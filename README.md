## House Price Prediction Dataset

### ðŸ“Œ Overview
This dataset contains information about various houses, including their features and sale prices. It is commonly used for building regression models to predict house prices based on different attributes such as area, number of rooms, and location.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset Details
- **Source:** [Kaggle House Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)
- **File Format:** CSV
- **Target Variable:** `SalePrice` (The price of the house in USD)
- **Number of Rows:** Varies based on the dataset version
- **Number of Features:** Multiple numerical and categorical attributes

### ðŸ“Š Features
The dataset contains many key features:

#### ðŸ”¹ Numerical Features such as:
- `LotArea` - Size of the lot in square feet
- `OverallQual` - Overall material and finish quality (1-10)
- `YearBuilt` - Original construction year
- `TotalBsmtSF` - Total square feet of basement area
- `GrLivArea` - Above ground living area in square feet
- `GarageCars` - Number of garage cars
- `GarageArea` - Size of garage in square feet

#### ðŸ”¹ Categorical Features such as:
- `Neighborhood` - Physical location within the city
- `HouseStyle` - Style of dwelling
- `RoofStyle` - Type of roof
- `SaleCondition` - Condition of sale (Normal, Abnormal, etc.)

### ðŸ›  Data Preprocessing Steps
To prepare the dataset for machine learning models, the following steps are recommended:
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Use mode imputation for categorical variables (`GarageYrBlt`, `GarageCars`, `BsmtFullBath`, `BsmtHalfBath`)
   - Use mean imputation for continuous variables (`MasVnrArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `GarageArea`)
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Encode categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
   - Scale numerical features for better model performance
3. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Detect and remove extreme values using statistical methods
4. **Splitting the Data**:
   - Split into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing)

### ðŸ“ˆ Modeling Approaches
You can use different regression models for price prediction:
- **Linear Regression**: A simple baseline model
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Captures non-linear relationships
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: Often provides the best performance
